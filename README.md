Cellular-Snowflake-Simulation
=============================
Briefly seen on [this Computerphile
Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TU3IQRV6LV0), I feelt the urge
to implement something similar, and this is it.

The graphical output is created with `matplotlib`, and I use `numpy` for
the cellular simulation. The implementation in `cellular.py` is inspired by [this
Github-Project](https://github.com/brahmcapoor/cellular-automata/blob/master/main.py)
by Brahm Capoor.

What is it good for?
